Section VIII	English-Chinese Translation

(1)
Let us suppose that you are in the position of a parent. Would you allow your children to read any book they wanted to without first checking its contents? Would you take your children to see any film without first finding out whether it is suitable for them? If your answer to these questions is ‘yes’, then you are just plain irresponsible. If your answer is ‘no’, then you are exercising your right as a parent to protect your children from what you consider to be undesirable influences. In other words, by acting as an examiner yourself, you are admitting that there is a strong case for censorship.
Now, of course, you will say that it is one thing to exercise censorship where children are concerned and quite another to do the same for adults. Children need protection and it is the parents’ responsibility to provide it. But what about adults? Aren’t they old enough to decide what is good for them? The answer is that many adults are, but don’t make the mistake of thinking that all adults are like yourself. Censorship is for the good of society as a whole. Like the law, it contributes to the common good.
Some people think that it is a shame that a censor should interfere with works of art. But we must bear in mind that the great proportion of books, plays and films which come before the censor are very far from being ‘works of art’.
When censorship laws are relaxed, dishonest people are given a chance to produce virtually anything in the name of ‘art’. One of the great things that censorship does is to prevent certain people from making fat profits by corrupting the minds of others. To argue in favour of absolute freedom is to argue in favour of anarchy. Society would really be the better if it were protected by correct censorship.

If the sun has enough power to warm and light the whole earth, it must have enough power to do other things, too. Can we use the sun’s abundant energy to supply electricity, or at least to perform the functions which electricity or other types of power usually perform? The answer is yes.
For example, people have for many years been using the reflected heat of the sun to cook by. Solar cookers have been built with several curved mirrors reflecting the sun and focusing its heat on the cooking element. This apparatus can be used just like a gas or electric stove; it is more expensive to make but it does not need any fuel, and so costs nothing to use. Another possibility of using solar energy is in house-heating.
The form of energy we use most is electricity, and every day more is needed. But electricity has to be made, too, and to make it huge quantities of fuel are required ― oil, coal, gas and nowadays even uranium.
The question which worries everyone today is: how long will these fuels last? Nobody knows for sure, but most experts think it will soon be difficult to obtain sufficient electricity from these sources. It is possible that the sun can make a contribution here, too.
Solar power has already been used to produce terrific hat. In Southern France a solar furnace has been built, where temperatures reach more than 3000° Centigrade. This furnace is only used for experiments at present, but could be used to produce steam for a power station.
So it is possible that one day in the near future we will depend on solar furnaces and power stations to provide our electrical needs. Or perhaps each home will have a solar generator to provide power for lighting and heating.
